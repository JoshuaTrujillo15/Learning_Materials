VULNERABILITY LOG

DATE TIME: 2020-10-13 11:42
URL: <REDACTED>/index.php/
STATUS: Inactive
ATTACK VECTOR: XSS
PAYLOAD: %22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert('hacked')%3C/script%3E
PAYLOAD RESULT: JavaScript alert 'hacked' displayed on webpage
VULNERABILITY: <form method="post" action="<?php echo $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"];?>">
PATCH: <form method="post" action="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]);?>">
DESCRIPTION:
	Form sends user input to itself to be used in PHP code execution. By sending data to itself via [action="<?php echo $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"];?>"], 
the code uses the url as a parameter. This creates a cross-site scripting vulnerability, where the attacker can append JavaScipt code to the url and 
execute it on the webpage. By adding the [htmlspecialchars()] function around [$_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]], XSS code will be converted to special HTML 
characters that render the appended JavaScript code useless.
