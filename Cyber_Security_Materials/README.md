# Cyber Security Materials

## This is NOT a comprehensive directory of all things cyber security.

This directory is for learning about and preventing common vulnerabilities in my code.

Most important of these will be the vulnerability log. Sensitive or compromising information will be cleaned up before pushing to github for obvious reasons. This is for educational purposes ONLY and should NEVER be used for anything illegal or unethical. Seriously.
