# Learning_Materials
This repository is for my own personal learning purposes.

Anyone is welcome to use this repository, but 
it is mostly notes taken, so it may seem unorganized.

ALSO: These are notes! Do not plug these files (such as shell scripts) directly into the terminal! All of the commands at once could create unintended problems!

Credit is given for each document when due,
and links are included when applicable!

P.S. Please forgive any strange inconsistencies in this repository due to transitioning from an old github account and from windows to linux. :)
